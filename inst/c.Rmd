Which speech sounds are more or less difficult for children to produce? Phonetic 
complexity scores (`sss` and `ttt`) assign the speech sounds different 
complexity levels based on biological principles outlined in Kent (1992).



Kent (1992) examined the ages of English consonant acqusition in Sander (1972) and 
observed that /p m n w h/ are mastered at age 3, /b d k g j f/ at age 4, /t ŋ r l/ at age 6 and /s z ʃ ʒ v θ ð tʃ dʒ/ after age 7. He then proceeds to describe motoric demands in each of these sets of sounds. I'll paraphrase:

  - Set 1 requires fast "ballistic" movements for stops /p m n/, slow
    "ramp" movements for /w h/, velopharyngeal control for oral-nasal
    contrast, laryngeal control for voicing contrast.
  - Set 2 adds more stops /b d k g/ and another ramp /j/ and a new place
    of articulation (velars), but also requires "fine force regulation
    for frication" for /f/.
  - Set 3 adds more stops /t ŋ/, but also requires tongue "bending" for
    /r/ and /l/.
  - Set 4 adds more lingual fricatives /s z ʃ ʒ θ ð/ which require
    tongue bending and fine force control along with /v tʃ dʒ/. Kent
    does not characterize the motor demands for the affricates /tʃ dʒ/.

Let's pause for a moment and observe that this breakdown is just an
attempt to describe the Sander (1972) consonant norms in terms of
articulatory motor demands. Specifically, the sets above correspond to the 
right edges on the following bar graph:

Kent (1992) description does not answer questions like "why is /d/ in
age 4 and /t/ in age 6?" or "why is /f/ in age 4 but /v/ in age 6?". But
it is fine to ignore those questions because they might be artefactual
features (quirks) of the source material. 

aside: For example, Sander (1972)
defined "customary articulation" as correct production of a sound in at
least two word positions (initial, medial and final). The main source of
Sander's norms (Templin, 1957), all children in the sample can produce
initial /t/ at age-3, but it takes until ages 6 or 7 for at least 90% of
the sample to produce /t/ correct in another position.


The main point of Kent's description, I think, is that lingual
(tongue) consonants are more difficult. Elsewhere in the chapter, Kent
(1992) describes how the tongue is a "muscular hydrostat" like an
elephant trunk, and bending a hydrostat requires coordination of
different muscle directions:

"*Gaining motor control over a hydrostat presents some special problems
to the young child learning speech. For one, bending the hydrostat is
unlike bending a jointed structure such as a finger. The tongue has no
joints per se; it flexes by appropriate contraction of its
three-dimensional network of intrinsic longitudinal, vertical, and
transverse fibers. Bending a hydrostat requires that muscle fibers be
shortened on one aspect simultaneously with a resistance to a change in
diameter (Smith and Kier 1989). If the diameter change is not resisted,
then the hydrostat will shorten on one side but will not bend. To use
the tongue in speech, the child must learn to control the tongue to meet
skeletal, movement, and shaping requirements, often simultaneously.
These special characteristics of the tongue may well play a role in
vowel and consonant mastery.*"

Kim and colleagues (2010) applied these developmental sets as articulatory complexity "levels" while examining consonant errors in dysarthric speech. They then asked questions such as whether more complex consonants had more consonant errors than less complex ones (*yes*) or whether lower intelligibility speakers made more complexity-reducing consonant substitutions than higher intelligibility speakers (*apparently so*).

Allison and Hustad (2014) used these complexity levels as a way to score the phonetic complexity of sentences. They assigned consonants 1--5 scores (the 1--4 complexity levels with 5 for consonants clusters), and summed up the scores to provide a complexity score for a sentence. 

Kuruvilla-Dugdale and colleagues (2018) elaborated on this scale.
