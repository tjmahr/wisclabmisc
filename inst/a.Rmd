## What is the purpose of these features?

The features provided by this package are meant to provide a standard
set of phonetic features for the American English speech samples that we
study in our lab. But why? 

When we are modeling something, at the phoneme level, like articulation
accuracy or phoneme probabilities from acoustic models, we would like to
**incorporate and evaluate our domain knowledge** about phonemes (speech
sounds) into our work. There are many speech sounds but the differences
among them are not arbitrary. We can use **phonetic features** to group
speech sounds together and make group comparisons: consonants versus
vowels, voiced versus voiceless consonants, and so on. We can also use
phonetic features to identify an articulatory "distance" between
phonemes: Phonemes with more features in common are more similar than
those with fewer features in common.

## What are phonetic features, like philosophically?

We produce most speech sounds by manipulating airflow from the lungs
through the larynx and through the oral or nasal cavities. We need a
system for describing how that airflow is shaped and filtered to make
sounds, and phonetic features are the conventional system for describing
sounds. I based the phonetic features in this package on the dimensions
used by the International Phonetic Association to organize the
International Phonetic Alphabet chart. 

First, let's make a few assumptions:
  
1.  There are discrete speech sounds.
2.  Each sound is an attempt at a particular configuration of speech
    articulators.
3.  Vowels and consonants are different kinds of things.

Assumptions 1 and 2 are stated by the IPA handbook: "Phonetic analysis
is based on the crucial premise that it is possible to describe speech
sounds in terms of a sequence of segments, and on the further crucial
assumption that each segment can be characterized by an articulatory
target." I read this in two ways. The first is that although speech is a
continuous and highly coordinated sequence of movements, we can break it 
down into more discrete states (speech sound segments) and we
can describe those states in terms of a particular configuration of the
speaker's jaw, lips, tongue, and so on (articulatory target). My second
reading emphasizes the word *target*. The target is a broad description
of an ideal or canonical position, but speakers can make small
adjustments as long they hit the general articulatory targets. So, we
are working at a usefully broad level of description when we list off
the sounds of a language and their phonetic features.

Assumption 3, is that there is a basic distinction between vowels and
consonants. There is some difference in articulation between vowels and
consonants. For vowels, the airflow is almost-always resonant (voicing
from the larynx) and largely unobstructed but tweaked by the position of
the tongue. For consonants, there is some constriction along the vocal
tract. But the primary conventional difference between consonants and
vowels is that vowels can be the "nucleus" (center) of a syllable, and
consonants generally cannot be the occupy the center of a syllable.

Putting this all together: phonetic features describe consonants and
vowels in terms of the articulatory states or gestures needed to make
those sounds.

### Features of consonants

We describe the consonants by using phonetic features that specify the
constriction in the vocal tract along with the state of larynx.

  - **place of articulation**: where the constriction occurs. When the
    lips create the closure, the place of articulation can be *bilabial*
    (both lips) and *labiodental* (bottom lip and top teeth). The tongue
    creates the closure, the place of articulation can be *dental*
    (tongue touches top teeth or goes between the top and bottom teeth),
    *alveolar* (at the alveolar ridge), *post-alveolar* (towards the
    "back" of the alveolar ridge), *palatal* (at the hard palate),
    *velar* (at the velum or front of the soft palate). The larynx may
    create a closure in a *glottal* consonant. Finally, both the lips
    and back of the tongue constrict in English's *labiovelar* consonant
    /w/.

  - **manner of articulation**: how much constriction occurs and whether
    anything else special is going on. We consider three main degrees of
    constriction. Sounds that barely constrict are *approximants*. Two
    approximants (/j,w/) are called *semivowels*; if you prolong
    them, they resemble vowels (/i,u/). Sounds where the constriction
    fully stops airflow are *stops*. When the stop is released, there is
    a burst of airflow and acoustic energy, so stops are also called
    *plosives*. Sounds that constrict enough to produce
    turbulent airflow are *fricatives*. Other manners of articulation
    are variations on these three levels of constriction. *Nasal* stops
    are stops that allow airflow through the nasal cavity. *Affricates*
    are a combination of a stop and fricative: The stop portion blocks
    airflow but the flow is released gradually into a fricative. In
    terms of articulation, /l/ and /r/ are both approximants but they
    are sometimes lumped under the fake umbrella term of *liquids*. 
  
  - **voicing**: whether the vocal folds in the larynx are closed and
    vibrating to produce voicing. /s/ and /z/ are two sounds that share
    the same place and manner of articulation (alveolar fricatives), but
    differ in their voicing. /s/ is *voiceless*, /z/ is *voiced*.


The chart of the [International Phonetic
Alphabet](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_Phonetic_Alphabet_chart)
arranges consonant sounds according to the above three features of place of
articulation (columns), manner of articulation (rows) and voicing (left and
right position in a cell).

### Features of vowels

Vowels are trickier. First, they are described along three main axes:

  - **height** of the tongue body. /i/ (as in "beet") is a *high* vowel,
    /ɛ/ (as in "bet") is a *mid* vowel, and /æ/ (as in "bat") is a *low*
    vowel. An alternate set of terms for high-mid-low is close-mid-open, where "close" describes the tongue being *close* to the roof of the mouth.
  
  - **backness** of the tongue body. /i/ (as in "beet") is a *front*
    vowel, /ʌ/ (as in "butt") is a *central* vowel, and /u/ (as in
    "boot") is a *back* vowel.
  
  - **rounding** of the lips. Rounding or protrusion of the lips
    lengthens the vocal tract which lowers the formant frequencies (resonances) of the vowel. In American English, /ɑ/ (as in "bot") is a low back
    *unrounded* vowel and /ɔ/ (as in "bought") is a low back *rounded*
    vowel, but there is a tendency for these two vowels to [merge into
    one sound](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cot%E2%80%93caught_merger).

The chart of the [International Phonetic
Alphabet](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_Phonetic_Alphabet_chart)
for vowels uses the height and backness features to arrange the sounds
into the "vowel quadrilateral". Within each height-backness combination,
the chart further differentiates between an unrounded and rounded vowel
in that position. The
vowels at the most extreme height (high, low) and backness (front, back)
values make up the "corner" vowels /i, æ, u, ɑ/.


But these articulatory features are not sufficient to differentiate the vowels of English. 
We need to add a fake feature to describe basic English vowels. 


  - **tenseness** of the vowel articulation. Both /i/ (as in "beet") and
    /ɪ/ as in "bit" are high front vowels, so we conventionally differentiate these two vowels by
    stipulating that /i/ is "tense" and /ɪ/ is lax. Other tense-lax
    pairs are /u,ʊ/ ("boot" and "book") and /eɪ,ɛ/ ("bait"). 

It's unclear what differentiates these tense and lax sounds in terms of
speech articulation. Adjustments in vowel height seem plausible (Johnson, Ladefoged and Lindau, 1993), and the IPA chart differentiates the high front vowels by placing /ɪ/ just a smidge lower than /i/ (near-close as instead of close).
    in vowel height. 


. Chomsky and Halle (1968) appealed to a vague articulatory 
difference in effort:

> Phonetically the difference between tense and lax vowels sounds can best be characterized a difference in the manner in which the articulatory gesture is executed. A tense sound is executed deliberately so that the articulating organs actually attain their various target configurations; in producing a lax sound, the gesture is executed rapidly and with reduced amplitude. Tense vowels are, therefore, distinguished from the corresponding lax vowels by being more intense, of longer duration, and articulated with a greater deviation of the vocal cavity from its neutral (rest) position. These facts have led to the description of lax vowels as being the "lazy" variances of the corresponding tense vowels. (SPE, Chapter 3.)


Johnson, Ladefoged and Lindau (1993) found that some speakers differentiated the tense and lax vowels by adjusting the height









### More big-idea remarks

I want to point out that phonetic features are **descriptive** and
**classificatory**. The features are descriptive: /p/ is *the* voiceless,
bilabial stop. Every Wikipedia article of an individual speech sound (like
[/p/](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Voiceless_bilabial_plosive)) begins by
enumerating its features. On the flipside, the features define natural
classes or classifications/categories of sounds: The "stops" are the
consonants that are made using a complete constriction of airflow at some
point along the vocal tract.

Note that all of these features reflect degrees of some tendency. That is,
there is some coherent way in which can order the individual features in a
set of phonetic feature. Place of articulation can be ordered from front
(lips and teeth) to back (tongue root and larynx). Manner can be ordered by
degree of constriction from stops (closure) to fricatives (near closure) to
approximants (much less constrictions), but there are secondary manner
features (nasal or lateral airflow, for example) that complicate a
single-dimensional ordering. Voicing is generally a binary category (voiced
versus voiceless), but that is a simplification and we might consider
degrees of airflow or vibration.




but we can break that sequence into a series of discrete states if we think of the speaker as trying to hit various articulatory targets.

we can still break that sequence down into a sequence of discrete states (segments) where 
work around that continuous nature by thinking of speech as moving to and from speech 

speech is made up of individual sounds called "segments", those segments are an attempt at a particular articulatory target. Although speech is continuous, We talk by moving from target position to target position.











(If you stretch out the consonants /w/ and /j/, you get the vowels /u/ and /i/.)
