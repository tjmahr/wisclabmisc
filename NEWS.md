# wisclabmisc 0.1.1.9000 (dev version)

* Suppressed warnings from `sessioninfo::session_info()` in `mem_gamlss()`.
* Updated regex for `tocs_item()`.
* Added `compute_overlap_rate()`.
* Added `compute_sens_spec_from_ecdf()` to compute sensitivity, specificity and 
  AUC on weighted data.
* Updated `compute_empirical_roc()` to handle multilevel data (like a rating 
  scale) if the two levels to be compared are provided in `levels`.
* Updated `compute_empirical_roc()` to support aliases for `direction`: 
  `"case-low"`/`"control-high"` and `"case-high"`/`"control-low"`. These forms
  help if you think about the direction or comparison as "which group gets a 
  low/high score?"
* Added `skip_block()`.
* Added `parse_year_month_age()` and `parse_yymm_age()` to convert formatted 
  ages into age in months.
* Add `audit` objects. These wrap some data and log the results of function 
  applications on the underlying data. These are designed for validating vectors 
  (e.g., filenames). Functions consist of `audit_wrap()`, `audit_peek()`, 
  `audit_poke()` and `audit_unwrap()`.

# wisclabmisc 0.1.1

* Added `file_rename_with()` and `file_replace_name()`.
* Added `info_surprisal()` and friends for computing entropy.
* Deprecated `check_sample_centiles()` deprecated. Use newly added 
  `check_model_centiles()` instead.
* Added `check_computed_centiles()` for calibrating precomputed centiles 
  (allows examining centiles outside of GAMLSS).

# wisclabmisc 0.1.0

* Package features up to November 2024
