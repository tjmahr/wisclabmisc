#' Fake speaking rate data
#'
#' A dataset of fake speaking rate measures for testing and demonstrating
#' modeling functions. These were created by randomly
#' sampling 200 rows of a speaking rate dataset and adding random noise to the
#' `age_months` and `speaking_sps` variables. These values do not measure any
#' real children but represent plausible age and rate measurements from our
#' kind of work.
