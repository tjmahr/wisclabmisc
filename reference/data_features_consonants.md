# Phonetic features of consonants and vowels

This package provides dataframes of information about the consonants and
vowels in American English. The *phonetic* features are conventional
descriptions of how sounds are produced. See also
[data_acq_consonants](https://www.tjmahr.com/wisclabmisc/reference/data_acq_consonants.md).

## Usage

``` r
data_features_consonants

data_features_vowels
```

## Format

An object of class `tbl_df` (inherits from `tbl`, `data.frame`) with 24
rows and 11 columns.

An object of class `tbl_df` (inherits from `tbl`, `data.frame`) with 17
rows and 13 columns.

## Details

Most of the phonetic features are self-evident and definitional. For
example, /p/ is *the* bilabial voiceless stop. For fuzzier features, I
consulted the general IPA chart and the Wikipedia page on English
phonology. These issues included things like: *what are the lax vowels
again?* or *the last two rows of the consonant tables are approximants,
so /r,l,j/ are approximants.*

Some features have alternative feature sets in order to accommodate
degrees of aggregation. For example, /r,l,j,w/ are *approximant* in
`manner` but divided into *liquid* and *glide* in `manner_alt`.

### Considerations about consonant phonetic features

The CMU alphabet does not include a glottal stop.

Here /f,v/ are coded as *strident* following
[Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sibilant) and *Sound Pattern
of English*. If this feature value doesn't seem right, we should
probably use an alternative feature of *sibilant* for the stridents
minus /f,v/.

The alternative voicing scheme was suggested by a colleague because of
how the voice-voiceless phonetic contrast is achieved with different
articulatory strategies in different languages. Note that `voicing_alt`
does not assign a feature to nasals or approximants.

### Considerations about vowel features

I don't consider /eɪ/ and /oʊ/ to be diphthongs, but perhaps
`manner_alt` could encode the difference of these vowels from the
others.

In the CMU alphabet and ARPAbet, vowels can include a number to indicate
vowel stress, so `AH1` or `AH2` is /ʌ/ but `AH0` is /ə/.

The vowel features for General American English, [according to
Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/English_phonology), are as
follows:

|            |          |       |         |       |      |       |
|------------|----------|-------|---------|-------|------|-------|
|            | Front    |       | Central |       | Back |       |
|            | lax      | tense | lax     | tense | lax  | tense |
| Close      | ɪ        | i     |         |       | ʊ    | u     |
| Mid        | ɛ        | eɪ    | ə       | (ɜ)   |      | oʊ    |
| Open       | æ        |       | (ʌ)     | ɑ     |      | (ɔ)   |
| Diphthongs | aɪ ɔɪ aʊ |       |         |       |      |       |

I adapted these features in this way:

- A four-level breakdown of height (high, mid-high, mid-low, low) was
  used instead of a three-level one (close, mid, open).

- *tense* and *lax* features were directly borrowed. Diphthongs and
  r-colored vowels are were not assign a tenseness.

- /ɑ/ moved to *back* (following the general IPA)

- diphthongs have no backness or height

- r-colored vowels were given the backness and height of the /ʌ,ə/

Based on the assumption that /ʌ,ə/ are the same general vowel with
differing stress, these vowels have the same features. This definition
clashes with the general IPA chart which places /ʌ/ as a back vowel.
However, /ʌ/ is a conventional notation. Quoting
[Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/English_phonology) again:
"Although the notation /ʌ/ is used for the vowel of STRUT in RP and
General American, the actual pronunciation is closer to a near-open
central vowel \[ɐ\] in RP and advanced back \[ʌ̟\] in General American."
That is, /ʌ/ is fronted in American English (hence, *mid*) in American
English.
