\usage{
impute_values_by_length(
  data,
  var_y,
  var_length,
  id_cols = NULL,
  include_max_length = FALSE,
  data_train = NULL
)
}
\arguments{
\item{data}{dataframe in which to impute missing value}

\item{var_y}{bare name of the response variable for imputation}

\item{var_length}{bare name of the length variable}

\item{id_cols}{a selection of variable names that uniquely identify each
group of related observations. For example, \code{c(child_id, age_months)}.}

\item{include_max_length}{whether to use the maximum length value as a
predictor in the imputation models. Defaults to \code{FALSE}.}

\item{data_train}{(optional) dataframe used to train the imputation models.
For example, we might have data from a reference group of children in
\code{data_train} but a clinical population in \code{data}. If omitted, the dataframe
in \code{data} is used to train the models. \code{data_train} can also be a
function. In this case, it is applied to the \code{data} argument in order
to derive (filter) a subset of the data for training.}
}
\value{
a dataframe with the additional columns \verb{\{var_y\}_imputed} (the
imputed value), \verb{.max_\{var_length\}} with the highest value of \code{var_length}
with observed data, and \verb{\{var_y\}_imputation} for labeling whether
observations were \code{"imputed"} or \code{"observed"}.
}
\description{
Impute missing data at different utterance lengths using successive linear
models.

\section{Background}{
In Hustad and colleagues (2020), we modeled intelligibility data in young
children's speech. Children would hear an utterance and then they would
repeat it. The utterances started at 2 words in length, then increased to 3
words in length, and so on in batches of 10 sentences, all the way to 7
words in length. There was a problem, however: Not all of the children could
produce utterances at every length. Specifically, if a child could not
reliably produced 5 utterances of a given length length, the task was halted.
So given the nature of the task, if a child had produced 5-word utterances,
they also produced 2--4-word utterances as well.

The length of the utterance probably influenced the outcome variable: Longer
utterances have more words that might help a listener understand the
sentence, for example. Therefore, it did not seem appropriate to ignore the
missing values. We used the following two-step procedure (see the
\href{https://doi.org/10.23641/asha.12330956.v1}{Supplemental Materials} for more
detail):
\subsection{Other notes}{

Remark about \code{data} and \code{data_train}: One might ask, \emph{why shouldn't some
children help train the data imputation models?} Let's consider a
norm-referenced standardized testing scenario: We have a new participant
(observations in \code{data}), and we want to know how they compare to their age
peers (participants in \code{data_train}). By separating out \code{data_train} and
fixing it to a reference group, we can apply the same adjustment/imputation
procedure to all new participants.
