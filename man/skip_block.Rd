\title{Skip a block of code without executing it}
\usage{
skip_block(...)
}
\arguments{
\item{...}{Either a single braced expression containing the code block to
skip, or a character string followed by a single braced expression.
When a message is supplied, it is printed instead of the default message.}
}
\value{
\code{NULL}, invisibly.
}
\description{
\code{skip_block()} is a lightweight control-flow helper to deliberately
skip execution of a block of code while still documenting that the block
exists. It is intended as an alternative to commenting out code
or wrapping code in \code{if (FALSE) { ... }}.
}
\details{
The function captures the unevaluated code block, reports how many lines
would have run, optionally prints a user-supplied message, and then returns
invisibly without evaluating the code.

\code{skip_block()} uses non-standard evaluation to capture the code block via
\code{substitute()}. The code block is never evaluated.

Supplying more than two arguments, or supplying no code block, is an error.

\examples{
skip_block({
  Sys.sleep(10)

skip_block("Skipping slow preprocessing step", {
    Sys.sleep(10)
  }
