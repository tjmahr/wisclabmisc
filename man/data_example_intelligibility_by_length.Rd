\title{Simulated intelligibility scores by utterance length}
\format{
A data frame with 694 rows and 5 variables:
\describe{
\item{child}{identifier for the child}
\item{age_months}{child's age in months}
\item{length_longest}{length of the child's longest utterance}
\item{tocs_level}{utterance length}
\item{sim_intelligibility}{child's intelligibility for the given utterance
length (proportion of words said by the child that were correctly
transcribed by two listeners)}
}
}
\usage{
data_example_intelligibility_by_length
}
\description{
A dataset of simulated intelligibility scores for testing and demonstrating
modeling functions. These were created by fitting a Bayesian model of the raw
Hustad and colleagues (2020) and drawing 1 sample from the posterior
distribution of expected predictions (i.e., "epreds). In other words, these
values are model predictions of the original dataset. They are correlated
with original dataset values at \emph{r} = .86. We might think of the simulation
as adding random noise to the original dataset.
