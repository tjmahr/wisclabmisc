\description{
This package provides dataframes of information about the consonants and
vowels in American English. The following datasets collect \emph{acquisition}
(\code{acq}) features which (try to) characterize the expected acquisition or
speech-motor difficulty of speech sounds. See also
\link{data_features_consonants}.

\subsection{Crowe and McLeod (2020) norms for English consonant acquisition}{

Crowe and McLeod (2020, below as the \code{cm2020_} variables) provides a
systematic review and summary statistics for age of acquisition norms for
English consonants. They scoured the literature of acquisition ages for
individual consonants and computed summary statistics on them. They
considered just accuracy of sounds when produced in single words. Their
sources include a mix of a journal articles and norms for articulation
assessments. They do not weight statistics from individual studies by sample
size or sampling procedure.

I prepared the Crowe and McLeod (2020) data by copying the relevant numbers
from their Table 2 making the following changes: 1) rounding mean and SD
values to 1 decimal point (3 days for ages in months), 2) dropping /ʍ/, 3)
using /r/, /g/, /tʃ/, /dʒ/ for IPA characters instead of the specialized
characters used in the article.

\subsection{The early 8, middle 8 and late 8 (Shriberg, 1993)}{

The English consonants are often broken down into three developmental
classes, based on Shriberg (1993):
\itemize{
\item Early 8: m b j n w d p h
\item Middle 8: t ŋ k g f v tʃ dʒ,
\item Late 8: ʃ θ s z ð l r ʒ
}

This classification is included as the \code{s93_eights} column.

From these names alone, we might interpret these classes such that sounds in
the Early 8 would be acquired before the ones in the Middle 8, and likewise
that the Middle 8 would be acquired before the Late 8. But these classes were
not created by examining patterns of typical consonant acquisition.

For some context, Shriberg (1993) introduces the Early 8, Middle 8, and Late
8 data by describing the following panel of the article's Figure 7:

\figure{shriberg_1993_600.png}

About which, Shriberg (1993) says:  \emph{"The values for this trend, which is a
profile of consonant mastery, were taken from a group of 64 3- to 6-year-old
speech-delayed children Shriberg, Kwiatkowski, & Gruber, 1992). Severity of
involvement of the 24 English consonants is represented as the percentage
correct for each consonant sorted in decreasing order from left to right.
Notice that the most obvious breaks in this function allow for a division of
the 24 consonants into three groups of eight sounds termed the
\strong{Early-8}, averaging over 75\% correct, the \strong{Middle-8}, averaging 25\%-75\%
correct, and the \strong{Late-8}, including consonants averaging less than 25\%
correct in continuous conversational speech (/ʒ/ is infrequently represented
in young, speech-delayed children's spontaneous conversational speech)."}

So, there were 64 3--6-year-old children with speech delays, and consonant
sounds were divided into three classes based on how often \emph{these
children} produced the sounds correctly on average in a conversational
speech sample. This classification is not so much a measure of the
relative ordering of speech sound development as it is \strong{the relative
difficulty of these sounds for children with a speech delay of unknown
origin}. It would be more appropriate to replace the levels of
Early/Middle/Late with Easy/Medium/Hard.
