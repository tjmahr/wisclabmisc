\subsection{Crowe and McLeod (2020) norms for English consonant acquisition}{

Crowe and McLeod (2020, below as the \code{cm2020_} variables) provides a
systematic review and summary statistics for age of acquisition norms for
English consonants. They scoured the literature of acquisition ages for
individual consonants and computed summary statistics on them. They
considered just accuracy of sounds when produced in single words. Their
sources include a mix of a journal articles and norms for articulation
assessments. They do not weight statistics from individual studies by sample
size or sampling procedure.

I prepared the Crowe and McLeod (2020) data by copying the relevant numbers
from their Table 2 making the following changes: 1) rounding mean and SD
values to 1 decimal point (3 days for ages in months), 2) dropping /ʍ/, 3)
using /r/, /g/, /tʃ/, /dʒ/ for IPA characters instead of the specialized
characters used in the article.
}

\subsection{English language phoneme frequencies}{

The \code{hml84_frequency} column provides the frequency count for the phonemes in
the Hoosier Mental Lexicon (Nusbaum, Pisoni, Pisoni, 1984). That is, we count
how many times the phonemes appear in each word in the word list and weight
them by the word frequency. For example, "ad" has two phonemes and a corpus
frequency of 99, so it counts for 99 /æ/ tokens and 99 /d/ tokens.

The HML frequency counts derive from the Brown Corpus of one million English
words that were printed/published in 1961. The HML provides frequencies of
\emph{phonological} words, and homophones are combined into a single entry. For
example, the word "ad" has a frequency of 99 (11 \emph{ad} tokens plus 88 \emph{add}
tokens). That's why, I suppose, it's a \emph{mental} lexicon. Approximately 8,000
words in the HML were not in the K&F frequency word list, and these are
apparently assigned a frequency of 1.

The \code{mhr82_frequency} column was constructed in a similar way but the frequencies
were based on a corpus of words used by first-graders
(Moe, Hopkins, & Rush, 1982).

The \code{hml84_log10fpm} and \code{mhr82_log10fpm} columns provide the frequency in log-10
frequency per million which is more appropriate for analyses. Computing
frequency per million normalize the frequency counts across different
corpora, and log-frequency is better suited than raw or normalized frequency
counts.

I computed these phoneme frequencies independently, but retrieved my copies
of the HML and MHR frequency-pronunciation tables from \href{https://kb.osu.edu/items/6b1379d3-e15d-53e4-99b6-85f2bb09b3af}{a course} by
Smith, Beckman and Foltz (2016).

\subsection{The early 8, middle 8 and late 8 (Shriberg, 1993)}{

The English consonants are often broken down into three developmental
classes, based on Shriberg (1993):
\itemize{
\item Early 8: m b j n w d p h
\item Middle 8: t ŋ k g f v tʃ dʒ,
\item Late 8: ʃ θ s z ð l r ʒ
}

This classification is included as the \code{s93_eights} column.

From these names alone, we might interpret these classes such that sounds in
the Early 8 would be acquired before the ones in the Middle 8, and likewise
that the Middle 8 would be acquired before the Late 8. But these classes were
not created by examining patterns of typical consonant acquisition.

For some context, Shriberg (1993) introduces the Early 8, Middle 8, and Late
8 data by describing the following panel of the article's Figure 7:

\figure{shriberg_1993_600.png}

About which, Shriberg (1993) says:  \emph{"The values for this trend, which is a
profile of consonant mastery, were taken from a group of 64 3- to 6-year-old
speech-delayed children Shriberg, Kwiatkowski, & Gruber, 1992). Severity of
involvement of the 24 English consonants is represented as the percentage
correct for each consonant sorted in decreasing order from left to right.
Notice that the most obvious breaks in this function allow for a division of
the 24 consonants into three groups of eight sounds termed the
\strong{Early-8}, averaging over 75\% correct, the \strong{Middle-8}, averaging 25\%-75\%
correct, and the \strong{Late-8}, including consonants averaging less than 25\%
correct in continuous conversational speech (/ʒ/ is infrequently represented
in young, speech-delayed children's spontaneous conversational speech)."}

So, there were 64 3--6-year-old children with speech delays, and consonant
sounds were divided into three classes based on how often \emph{these
children} produced the sounds correctly on average in a conversational
speech sample. This classification is not so much a measure of the
relative ordering of speech sound development as it is \strong{the relative
difficulty of these sounds for children with a speech delay of unknown
origin}. It would be more appropriate to replace the levels of
Early/Middle/Late with Easy/Medium/Hard.
}

\subsection{Phonetic complexity (Kent, 1992; Kuruvilla-Dugdale et al. 2018)}{

Phonetic complexity measures (\code{k1992_set} and \code{kd2018_complexity})
assign the speech sounds different complexity levels based on biological
principles outlined in Kent (1992). Because Kent (1992) is a book
chapter that is not floating around online, it's worthwhile to review
the provenance of these complexity measures. In short, Kent (1992) applied
interpreted consonant and vowel development data in terms of their
motor demands.

Sander (1972) set out to construct a set of developmental norms for
typical consonant acquisition in English. His big idea was to include
the median age of acquisition as well as the 90th percentile age of
acquisition. The median can tell us something about the average
acquisition of the speech sounds, and the 90th percentile can set a
benchmark for delayed acquisition. There are some quirks of the
methodology. First, Sander (1972) was targeting "customary articulation"
which was defined using production accuracy average across word
positions. So, the age of 50\% customary articulation for /t/ is the
earliest age when the average of word-initial accuracy, word-medial
accuracy and word-final accuracy is greater than 50\%. Second, the norms
for this study were created by augmenting data from 3--8-year-olds
(Templin, 1957; \emph{n} = 480) with some earlier data for 2-year-olds
(Wellman et al. 1931; \emph{n} = 15).

Sander (1972) presented these acquisition norms in the following figure:

\figure{sander_1972_400.png}

Kent (1992) aimed to explain the course of English sound development in
terms of biological and motoric principles. He examined the ages of 90\%
acquisition from Sander (1972)---that is, the right edges of the bars in
the previous figure---and observed that /p m n w h/ are mastered at
age 3, /b d k g j f/ at age 4, /t ŋ r l/ at age 6 and /s z ʃ ʒ v θ ð tʃ
dʒ/ after age 7. He then described motoric demands in each of these sets
of sounds. I'll paraphrase:
\itemize{
\item Set 1 requires fast "ballistic" movements for stops /p m n/, slow
"ramp" movements for /w h/, velopharyngeal control for oral-nasal
contrast, laryngeal control for voicing contrast.
\item Set 2 adds more stops /b d k g/ and another ramp /j/ and a new place
of articulation (velars), but also requires "fine force regulation
for frication" for /f/.
\item Set 3 adds more stops /t ŋ/, but also requires tongue "bending" for
/r/ and /l/.
\item Set 4 adds more lingual fricatives /s z ʃ ʒ θ ð/ which require
tongue bending and fine force control along with /v tʃ dʒ/. Kent
does not characterize the motor demands for the affricates /tʃ dʒ/.
}

Let's pause for a moment and observe that this breakdown is just an
attempt to describe the Sander (1972) norms, and it is somewhat
underdeveloped. For example, why is /t/ in Set 3 but /d/ in Set 2? It is
not answered here, but I think this late mastery is an artefact of
Sander's requirement of 90\% accuracy averaging over the three
word-positions. The medial and final productions of /t/ might require
allophonic variation in /t/ (e.g., flapping or glottalization), so
mastery of /t/ would require different motor gestures and some
phonological knowledge on the part of the child. But in Kent's
description /t/ is a later-mastered ballistic movement.

Still, the main point of Kent's description, I think, is that lingual
(tongue) consonants are more difficult. Elsewhere in the chapter, Kent
(1992) describes how the tongue is a "muscular hydrostat" like an
elephant trunk, and bending a hydrostat requires coordination of
different muscle directions:

\emph{"Gaining motor control over a hydrostat presents some special problems
to the young child learning speech. For one, bending the hydrostat is
unlike bending a jointed structure such as a finger. The tongue has no
joints per se; it flexes by appropriate contraction of its
three-dimensional network of intrinsic longitudinal, vertical, and
transverse fibers. Bending a hydrostat requires that muscle fibers be
shortened on one aspect simultaneously with a resistance to a change in
diameter (Smith and Kier 1989). If the diameter change is not resisted,
then the hydrostat will shorten on one side but will not bend. To use
the tongue in speech, the child must learn to control the tongue to meet
skeletal, movement, and shaping requirements, often simultaneously.
These special characteristics of the tongue may well play a role in
vowel and consonant mastery."}

Kim and colleagues (2010) applied these developmental sets (\code{k1992_set}) as
articulatory complexity \emph{levels} while
examining consonant errors in dysarthric speech. They then asked
questions such as whether more complex consonants had more consonant
errors than less complex ones (\emph{yes}) or whether lower intelligibility
speakers made more complexity-reducing consonant substitutions than
higher intelligibility speakers (\emph{apparently so}). Examining the speech
of 5-year-olds, Allison and Hustad (2014) later used these complexity
levels as a way to \emph{score} the phonetic complexity of sentences. They
assigned consonants 1--5 scores (the 1--4 complexity levels with a score
of 5 for consonants clusters), and summed up the scores to provide a
complexity score for a sentence. Three of the eight 5-year-olds with
dysarthria showed a negative effect of sentence complexity on
intelligibility.

Kent (1992) also described the yearly developmental progression of
vowels. I'll paraphrase again:
\itemize{
\item By age 1: Infants produce \emph{vocants} (vowel precursors) which
correspond to the low-front, central and low-back vowels /æ ɛ ʌ ə
ɑ/. Thus, the tongue only moves in the anterior-posterior direction
(i.e., there is limited up-down movement).
\item By age 2: Toddlers produce the "maximally dissimilar" corner vowels
/i u ɑ/ and produce /o/ and the central vowels /ʌ ə/.
\item By age 3: Children incorporate two lower vowels /ɛ ɔ/ and the
diphthongs /aɪ aʊ ɔɪ/ which require gliding movements.
\item By age 4: Children incorporate the remaining non-rhotic vowels /ʊ ɪ
e æ/. The appearance of the front vowels suggests that tongue-jaw
coordination is a relatively late motor achievement. (/i/ appears
earlier because its extreme height is easy.)
\item Lastly: Children incorporate /ɚ ɝ/ last because these r-colored
vowels require tongue bending.
}

Kuruvilla-Dugdale and colleagues (2018) used this description to
incorporate vowels into the phonetic complexity scale
(\code{kd2018_complexity}). The /ʌ ə ɑ/ vocants from age 1 and the vowels
from age 2 mark the bottom of the complexity scale. The vowels that are
acquired at ages 3, 4 and afterwards are assigned to the consonant
complexity levels with the same age of mastery. Finally, consonant
clusters serve as the ceiling for the scale:

Table: Phonetic complexity scores from Kuruvilla-Dugdale et al. (2018).\tabular{rll}{
   kd2018_complexity \tab consonants \tab vowels \cr
   1 \tab  \tab ʌ ə ɑ \cr
   2 \tab  \tab i u oʊ \cr
   3 \tab p m n h w \tab ɛ ɔ aʊ aɪ ɔɪ \cr
   4 \tab b d k g f j \tab ɪ eɪ æ ʊ \cr
   5 \tab t ŋ l r \tab ɝ ɚ \cr
   6 \tab tʃ dʒ v θ ð s z ʃ ʒ \tab  \cr
   7 \tab 2-consonant clusters \tab  \cr
   8 \tab 3-consonant clusters \tab  \cr
}


It is not clear how to apply this scale, so my approach has been to
break words into subsyllabic units and assign scores to the syllable
onsets, nucleui and codas in each word. For example, "jump" is /dʒ/ +
/ʌ/ + /mp/ so it would have complexity of 6 + 1 + 7 = 14, and "jumper"
includes a syllable break between the cluster, so it would have a
score 6 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 5 = 14.

Kuruvilla-Dugdale and colleagues (2018) used this scoring system to
compare intelligibility for low complexity versus high complexity words.
For example, for speakers with ALS and mild dysarthria, there was
statistically clear reduction in intelligibility for high complexity
words but not for low complexity words. I applied this scoring system on
single-word intelligibility in children's speech (Mahr & Hustad, 2023).
There was a probable but not statistically clear negative effect of
complexity on intelligibility over and above the effects of age, word
frequency and word neighborhood competition. (Regrettably, I coded the
one consonant cluster in the word list with a complexity of 8 instead
of 7, but otherwise this is the approach.)
